# Overview
Stackchain is a simple blockchain designed for building distributed applications, configuration management systems, policy-based access control mechanisms, and more. The goal of Stackchain is to break COMPLETELY away from financial concepts, tokenization, initial coin offerings (ICO), and all of the other hype-driven madness that has plagued other blockchains.
Instead, Stackchain is focused on being entirely transparent, portable, and simplistic so that decentralized applications can be deployed quickly and effectively. 

Stackchain is not designed to be a singleton chain where thousands of nodes co-exist and operate in the same chain. It is designed to be used in disparate chains where multiple agents contribute to a network for a singular purpose. For example, Stackchain
could be used as the basis for coordinating the configuration of a distributed network of Raspberry Pis used for sensor data gathering or managing policy-based access controls for a set of geographically
diverse edge servers for a large enterprise.
